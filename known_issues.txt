- Can't have a super templated type without specifying full name of template argument

- Even though i is updated in the loop:
 1210:3 src\test\resources\validtests\Advent Of Code 2018\Day4\Day4Star1.t    │
│ Indexing expression id is out of bounds: -1 < 0.     

- Logs error with [untyped]:
Def Value() =
	var v = 0
	if(Children.Size() == 0)
		for(val m in MetaData) v += m
	else
		for(val m in MetaData) v += Children[m].Value()
	v
The class Int does not define an operator Int + [untyped].

- Ternary doesn't prove non nullableness:
Def toString() = Task ? "(" + Task + ": " + FinishedAt + ")" : "Free"
Errors on Task

- Cannot add Nullable types to Strings.

- Array comparison should use Arrays.equals

- Unreachable code warning is weird for larger code blocks

- Cast to nullable fails with CodeFreezingException
